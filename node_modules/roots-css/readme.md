Roots CSS
---------

Roots css is a terse, feature-rich css library built on top of stylus. It's a child of the [roots build system](http://github.com/jenius/roots-cli), but is totally old enough to live on it's own. It can be integrated as a plugin for stylus or included manually.

Detailed documentation coming very soon. The code is commented pretty thoroughly though, if you want to comb through it.

#### To Do
- finish writing all the tests
